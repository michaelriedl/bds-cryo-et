# Data Folder Placeholder

This folder is intended to store the data required for the project. Please ensure that all data files are organized and follow the structure outlined below.

## Folder Structure

```
/data
├── raw/          # Raw data files (unprocessed)
└── processed/    # Processed data files
```

## Guidelines

1. **Do not commit large data files** to the repository. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
2. Use descriptive filenames for all data files.
3. Document any changes made to the data in a separate log file.

## Notes

- If this folder is empty, it may be because the data files are not included in the repository. Check the project documentation for instructions on obtaining the required data.
- Ensure compliance with any licensing or usage restrictions for external data.
